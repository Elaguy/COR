BUGS
====
(Not a complete list of all the bugs ever. I only started documenting bugs on 12/17/17.)

** (FIXED) ** 1. When the PlasmaBullets are deleted when they hit the AICar, weird stuff
happens especially with the AICar's hit and not hit textures.

** (FIXED) ** 2. When the AICar is destroyed, when the playerCar runs into the LandMines,
no explosion animation seems to occur besides the last frame of the animation, the "ashes".

** (FIXED) ** 3. When the AICar is destroyed, it's speed is not even close to 0, and so it still
places mines.

** (FIXED) ** 4. Text supposed to be on the two buttons on the ending UI are floating somewhere completely
different.

** (ON HOLD, PROBABLY WON'T BE FIXED, I TRIED) ** 5. The ending message stating who won the race continues to be colored white instead of 
red or green, which depends on whether the player won the race or not. == LOW PRIORITY ==

6. When the AICar's acceleration is set above 0.1, it glitches at a waypoint. (Probably fixed)

** (FIXED) ** 7. When the game is put on fullscreen during the main menu, the ending UI is not placed at the right
position.

** (FIXED) ** 8. When the playerCar is moving, the "Quit Game" button text on the ending UI 'quivers' or 'shakes'.

9. When the game is put on fullscreen during the main menu, the ending UI's updating/input gathering is very slightly buggy.
The selection detection is off slightly, extending past the buttons to their right. == LOW PRIORITY ==
