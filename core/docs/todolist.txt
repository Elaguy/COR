BUGS
====
(Not a complete list of all the bugs ever. I only started documenting bugs on 12/17/17.)

** (FIXED) ** 1. When the PlasmaBullets are deleted when they hit the AICar, weird stuff
happens especially with the AICar's hit and not hit textures.

** (FIXED) ** 2. When the AICar is destroyed, when the playerCar runs into the LandMines,
no explosion animation seems to occur besides the last frame of the animation, the "ashes".

** (FIXED) ** 3. When the AICar is destroyed, it's speed is not even close to 0, and so it still
places mines.
