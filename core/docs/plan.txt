1. If center car position is < midpoint:
	Increase this car's speed by this car's acceleration

2. If center car position is == the midpoint:
	Do nothing? Car will keep going (friction is still involved, though)

3. If center car position > midpoint:
	Decrease this car's speed by this car's acceleration

4. Once waypoint is completed (probably use boolean variable for this),
move on to the next waypoint on the list, whether or not it is registered
for this car or not
